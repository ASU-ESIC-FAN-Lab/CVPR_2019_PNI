## Dependencies:
  
  
* Python 3.6 (Anaconda)
* Pytorch 4.1
  
## Set up A Conda python Environment
Anaconda allows you to have different environments installed on your computer to access different versions of `python` and different libraries. Sometimes, the conflict of library versions may causes errors and packages not working.
